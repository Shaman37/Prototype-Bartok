# Prototype-Bartok
This project is a Unity Example Game from the book [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development, 2nd Edition](https://book.prototools.net/), by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

It is a card game prototype, similar to the commercial game [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)), with less rules and played with a standard card deck.

You can play it online [here!](https://shaman37.itch.io/prototype-bartok)
## How to play

The game is played against 3 AI players.

At the start of the round, a _hand_ of 7 cards is dealt to each player and a _target card_ is drawn from the _draw pile_.
A player may play a card from her hand if:
- That card matches the _rank_ of the target card;
- That card matches the _suit_ of the target card;

If the player cannot play a card from her hand, she must draw a single card from the draw pile and her turn is concluded.

The first player to get rid of all of her cards wins.
